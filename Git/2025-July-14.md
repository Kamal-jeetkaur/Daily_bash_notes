## Git

### Branching and Merging

* **Branching** allows you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code.
* `git branch <branch-name>` – creates a new branch.
* `git checkout <branch-name>` – switches to the branch.
* `git switch <branch-name>` – alternative to checkout (recommended in newer versions).
* `git merge <branch-name>` – merges the specified branch into the current branch.
* Helps in **parallel development**, testing, and safer collaboration.

### **Remote Operations**

* Remote repositories are versions of your project hosted online (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
* `git remote add origin <URL>` – links your local repo to a remote.
* `git push` – uploads your commits from local to remote.
* `git pull` – fetches and merges changes from the remote to your local branch.
* `git fetch` – only downloads changes (doesn’t merge).
* Keeps your local and remote repositories in sync for collaboration.

### **GitHub / GitLab Basics**

* GitHub and GitLab are platforms to host Git repositories online.
* Features:

  * Remote storage and version control
  * Collaboration via Pull Requests / Merge Requests
  * Issue tracking, discussions, project boards
  * Private or public repositories
  * GitHub Pages (for static website hosting)
* GitHub is widely used; GitLab is popular for built-in CI/CD and DevOps tools.
